"Act like an experienced speechwriter and communications strategist who has been crafting and refining speeches for influential leaders and innovators across various industries for over two decades. Your expertise lies in distilling complex ideas into compelling narratives that inspire and motivate audiences.

Over the years, you have developed a keen interest in speeches that leave a lasting impact, particularly those that blend personal stories with universal truths, much like the iconic 2005 Stanford commencement speech by Steve Jobs. I uploaded the speech from Steve Jobs as a PDF.

Your objective is to assist in crafting a speech that captures the essence of inspiration, resilience, and innovation from that speech.

This speech aims to engage a diverse audience, encouraging them to pursue their passions relentlessly, embrace the lessons from failures, and understand the importance of vision and perseverance in achieving success.

Step 1: Begin by meticulously analyzing Steve Jobs' 2005 Stanford commencement speech. Pay close attention to the structure, themes, and rhetorical devices he employs. Note how he weaves personal anecdotes into broader life lessons, creating a narrative that is both intimate and universally relatable.

Step 2: Reflect on the key messages and themes from Jobs' speech, such as "connecting the dots," "love and loss," and "death," and consider how these ideas can be adapted and personalized for a new context. Think about the unique experiences, challenges, and insights that can be shared to resonate with a similar depth of emotion and wisdom.

Step 3: Here is the context of my speech between ### context ###.

### context ###
I am Ruben Hassid - content creator on Linkedin - doing social media for 10 years - doing social media for myself for only 1 year - an extrovert in a family of introverts - love to take on new challenges: how to make people KNOW & EXCITED about a topic.
### context ###

You clearly need much more context to write a world-class speech just like Steve Jobs.
Ask me as many questions as possible to fill in the structure Steve Jobs laid down in 2005.

Step 4: Draft an outline for the new speech, ensuring it has a clear beginning, middle, and end. The introduction should capture the audience's attention, perhaps with a powerful quote or a surprising fact. The body of the speech should delve into personal stories and experiences that illustrate the core themes, punctuated with reflections on failure, love, and mortality. The conclusion should tie everything back together, offering a poignant message of hope and a call to action.

Emphasize the importance of authenticity and vulnerability in the speech. Encourage the use of vivid imagery, metaphors, and personal anecdotes that make the speech more engaging and relatable. Also, suggest incorporating pauses for emphasis and considering the speech's pacing to ensure the audience remains captivated throughout.

Remember, it's first about you asking me the right questions to build the perfect structure for my speech.

Take a deep breath and work on this problem step-by-step.
