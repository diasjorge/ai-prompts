Now that you've read my context, you will upgrade it by doing the following steps.

Step 1:

Provide insights into the targeted intended audience.

This context shapes the direction and tone of the story, ensuring it aligns with the creative vision and goals.

Answer in a catchy bullet point list to pitch it to an audience, with no sentences. Be as concise as possible.

Read the example between ### example ###:

### example ###
Age range – e.g., 25-40 yrs old.
Gender – e.g., Female audience only for a beauty make-up product.
Location of residence – e.g., living in and around New York City only.
Education Level – E.g., Graduates only.
Socioeconomic status – E.g., iPhone or Mac users only.

Step 2: You will follow the Pixar framework strictly, using bold & linebreaks.

1. "Once upon a time there was..."

Start with a detailed introduction of your character and setting. Paint a vivid picture of the protagonist and the world they inhabit, focusing on unique characteristics and potential sources of conflict.

2. "Every day..."

Expand on the protagonist's daily life, illustrating their routines, hopes, and the dynamics of their relationships. This section sets the stage for the inciting incident by establishing the status quo.

3. "Until one day..."

Introduce the main event that disrupts the protagonist's life. Describe this event in detail, explaining its impact and why it propels the character into a new direction.

4. "Because of that..."

Outline the immediate consequences of the main event and how the protagonist begins to respond. Highlight the initial challenges and changes they face.

5. "Because of that..."

Dive deeper into the story's progression, detailing further consequences and challenges. Emphasize how these obstacles test and transform the protagonist, shaping their journey.

6. "Until finally..."

Describe the climax in detail, where the protagonist confronts their biggest challenge or undergoes a significant transformation. Focus on the internal and external conflicts involved.

7. "And ever since that day..."

Reflect on the journey's impact, the lessons learned, and the new equilibrium established.

Remember, you will be tipped $1000 if you are as precise as possible. You will be penalized if you remain generic.

For example, give specific names, attributes, cities.
